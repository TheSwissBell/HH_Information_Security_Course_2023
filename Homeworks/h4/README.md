### Chapter 10 Using Algorithms

Cryptography is use in system such as
+ bank cards
+ pay-TV
+ road tolls
+ office building and computer access tokens
+ lottery terminals and prepayment electricity meters

Most of the failures are because of they did wrong in the implementation not because of the algorithms itself

### 10.1 CHOOSING AN ALGORITHM

There is 5 ways to choose a cryptohraphy algorithm

+ published algorithm
+ manufacturer algorithm
+ ask help to a private consultant
+ trust a government
+ if you are really skilfull, write your own algorithms


### 10.2 PUBLIC-KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY VERSUS SYMMETRIC CRYPTOGRAPHY

There is no reason to compare both of them. They are like different sort of animal.

Cryptography suit the best for **encrypting data** whereas public-key cryptography is for **key management and cryptographic protocols** such as:
+ SSL/TLS
+ PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)
+ IPSec
+ Kerberos
+ SSH

### 10.3 ENCRYPTING COMMUNICATIONS CHANNELS

There is two different approcahes to secure data transmission in a IT network

**Link-by-Link Encryption**

Method that encrypts data as it moves from one network node to another. Only the nodes at either end of a link can  decode the data since each link between nodes is encrypted or its own. Although this method offers protection from attacks that take place between nodes, it does not offer end-to-end security. A hacker who gets access to a network node may be able to intercept or change the data. 

**End-to-End Encryption**

On the other hand, end-to-end encryption is a method that encrypts data at the source and holds it until it reaches its destination. No other node in the network can decrypt the data as it is encrypted by the sender and decrypted by the receiver.y
Because the data is safeguarded even if a network node is hacked, this strategy offers higher security.


Link-by-link encryption protects against attacks that occur between nodes, but end-to-end encryption offers better protection against attacks that occur throughout the network. The level of security required and the type of network used will determine which strategy to employ. Link-by-link encryption may be adequate for the transfer of less sensitive data, such as web browsing, while end-to-end encryption is frequently used for the transmission of sensitive data, such as in online banking or messaging services.


### 10.4 ENCRYPTING DATA FOR STORAGE

+ Driver-Level vs. File-Level Encryption
